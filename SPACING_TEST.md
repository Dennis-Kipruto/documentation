# Main Heading

This is a paragraph after the main heading. It should have proper spacing above and below.

## Section Header

This paragraph follows a section header. Notice the appropriate spacing between elements.

### Subsection Header

Here's some content under a subsection. The spacing should be consistent.

This is another paragraph with normal text. Multiple paragraphs should have good spacing between them.

- First bullet point
- Second bullet point 
- Third bullet point with more content

After a list, we should see proper spacing to the next element.

1. First numbered item
2. Second numbered item
3. Third numbered item

## Another Section

Here we have a section after a list. The spacing should be optimal.

> This is a blockquote. It should have proper margins above and below.
> 
> Multiple paragraphs in blockquotes should also be spaced well.

After a blockquote, regular content should have appropriate spacing.

```javascript
// Code blocks should also have proper spacing
function example() {
    return "This code block should be well-spaced";
}
```

After code blocks, content should resume with proper spacing.

### Table Example

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     | More     |
| Row 2    | Content  | Here     |

Tables should also have appropriate spacing above and below.

## Final Section

The spacing improvements ensure that:
- Headers have consistent margins
- Paragraphs breathe properly
- Lists are well-separated
- Code blocks stand out
- Tables are clearly defined
- All elements maintain visual hierarchy

**Bold text** and *italic text* should integrate seamlessly with normal content flow.

This horizontal rule above should also have proper spacing, and this final paragraph demonstrates the overall improved readability of the markdown rendering.
